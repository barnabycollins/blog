Okay, so you're probably here because you need to record a large group of
musicians. Before I get into the concrete setup guide, I'm going to go over a
little bit of the theory.

Chances are that your group are performing in a lovely big echoey room. The
recording is inevitably going to capture some of that sound, which is good. But
as nice as the reverb is, it's also important to make sure that you get a good
clear recording with a good amount of sound coming directly from the instruments
themselves. In order to achieve this, the sweet spot is generally to place the
microphones at the front of the group, probably just behind the conductor. It's
a good idea to err on the side of being closer, because it's easy to add more
reverb and (pretty much) impossible to take it away.

One of the other main considerations is stereo width. Put simply, we have two
ears, and some techniques are going to give you 'wider' signals (that is,
signals with more differences between the two ears) than others. In a vacuum,
more stereo width is a good thing because it sounds nice, but it shouldn't come
at the cost of things sounding natural.

For these orchestral recordings, you generally want a faithful reproduction of
the sound with minimal colouration and high fidelity even in quiet sections.
You're also probably not using the microphones for amplification, so feedback
won't be an issue. For this reason, you're almost certainly going to use
condenser microphones. These microphones are perfect for the job, but it's worth
you knowing that condensers need 'phantom power'. This is when the microphone
cable not only carries the audio from the mic back to the recorder but also
carries 48V in the opposite direction to polarise the microphone's diaphragm.

Finally, there are two main kinds of 'pickup pattern' to discuss. A microphone's
pickup pattern defines what directions it is sensitive to incoming sound from. A
'cardioid' microphone is most sensitive to things in front of it and tends to
'reject' sound from behind it, whereas an 'omnidirectional' microphone picks up
sound (pretty much) equally from all directions.


# Step 0: Choose your microphone setup
Next up, you need to think about what physical setup you're going to use. Since
this guide is primarily written for people that are borrowing equipment from
Music Durham, I'm going to focus on the equipment that we have. That doesn't
mean it's not applicable to other equipment too though!

There are a few main options in terms of how you set up the microphones. In
general, you want your main microphones to all be in one place to reduce phase
issues and to make the recording sound more natural (since someone sitting in
the room would be sitting in one place too - they wouldn't have ears spread
around the room). You'll get the "best" sound just behind (and/or above) the
conductor, so that's where you want to put your main microphones! As a general
rule, 3-4m off the ground is a pretty good sweet spot as it means sound won't be
blocked by things like musicians or the conductor but is still reasonably close
to the performers.

For a bigger orchestra (or more professional recording), you may also want to
place 'outrigger microphones' either side of centre to capture sound from the
wider fringes of the orchestra, but I'm not going to discuss this here.

This is one of the most foolproof options. Basically, XY stereo places two
microphones on top of each other, pointing approximately 90 degrees apart,
either side of the centre line. The mics need to be cardioid, or you'd just be
sampling the same point in space twice! At Music Durham, we have a pair of Rode
M5 microphones that are perfect for XY stereo.

Pros:
- Almost impossible to set up wrong
- No phase issues
- Only needs one mic stand
- Only needs two mics (and two channels on your recorder)
- Angle can be adjusted to suit the width of the ensemble

Cons:
- Not much stereo width (you're only reliant on the microphones' pickup
  patterns)
- May miss the centre of the group if the mics are angled too wide
