If you're reading this, chances are you've been asked to write a rider for the
first time, and you're not sure what you're supposed to be doing. A rider is a
crucial part of making sure a gig goes smoothly, so here's how to write a good
one (from a technician's perspective)!

I've included a range of different things here; if you're a small band
performing in a small gig then you probably won't need much more than the first
table below when constructing your rider.

One last thing before I get started - please don't forget to be nice! It's
possible to be professional and precise without sacrificing personality and
friendliness :)


# Equipment list

The first thing you'll need is to make it clear who's in your band, what they
play, what they have and what they need. A good way of laying this out is in a
table, like this:

> |Performer                      |Instrument             |Provided equipment                                     |Required equipment                             |
> |-------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
> |DJ Khaled (he/him)             |Bass kazoo             |Bass kazoo, high stool                                 |Instrument mic (Shure SM57 or similar)         |
> |Rick Astley (he/him)           |Electric guitar        |Electric guitar, refusal to give you up                |Guitar amplifier (min. 50W)\*, amp mic / DI    |
> |Squidward (they/them)          |Casio RAP-1 Rapman     |The world's 1st rap keyboard                           |1x mains power socket, 3.5mm mono output       |
> |Queen Elizabeth II (she/her)   |Vocals, didgeridoo     |Telefunken M80 Gold microphone, gold-plated mic stand  |Instrument mic for didgeridoo, crown storage\* |
> 
> (*: can be provided if necessary)

Make sure to include less obvious items on this list, and state their purpose so
technicians get an idea of what's needed and how it all fits together! These
items may include:
- Pedals / pedalboards
- Tables & seating
- Music stands
- Mic stands (if you have specific needs in this area)

If you have preferences don't be afraid to state those too, but bear in mind
that smaller-scale events and venues will only have limited tech selections.


## Bonus points

Bonus points are available for:
- Listing the number of mixer channels used by each person
- Being specific on the setup of more complicated instruments like drum kits
- Including exact models of any electronic equipment you do bring
- Noting anywhere that condenser mics or DIs will be needed (this way the
  technician knows where to send phantom power)

Also, there's no such thing as too much detail - even if you're, eg, running a
MIDI keyboard into a synth, or you like to have your laptop nearby to keep an
eye on a recording, mentioning that will only stop there being any unpleasant
surprises during the event. Plus, many technicians will be interested to see how
you're applying tech to make cool noises come out of their speakers!


# Other technical information

This is where you'd add any info about technical requirements that aren't
covered in the main equipment list. For example, you could describe the setup
you use for monitoring (eg if you have your own IEM rack), or if there are any
non-standard things to be aware of. If you're really pro, have your own
technician/mixer and/or you're the only band performing at that event, you can
even list the mixer channels you use for each instrument to be super clear on
what's needed.

You can also use this section to specify things like whether individual members
want their own specific monitor feeds (and whether they want personal control
over them), what kinds of effects you might want on the sound, and if you have
any preferences for the speaker or mixing setup. If there is a specific sound
you're after, providing sound clips is a good idea!

Finally, it may be handy to provide a set list for more formal events,
particularly if you expect your tracks to vary in, eg, instrumentation, or
desired sound. It will also help technicians understand the structure and length
of your performance.


# Stage plan

It's common, particularly with more professional bands and venues, to send over
a rough map of the stage. It's not essential for smaller gigs, particularly when
you're one of several bands sharing the same stage at a small event, but if your
band is particular about how things should be set up it's a great way of
communicating that in advance.

You don't strictly need to include actual people, because those will (in a
normal event at least) not be placed by technicians, but you should include:
- Drum kits, keyboards and other static instruments
- Stage monitors
- Amplifiers
- Any other static equipment you might be bringing yourselves (eg, IEM racks or
  pedalboards)
- Places where you need power - bonus points for
  - specifically marking out spots to leave extension leads
  - noting the number of plugs that will be required in each location
- Places that need to be left unblocked for movement on stage (not strictly
  necessary but possibly useful if your band moves around a lot)

You can also include items you expect technicians to provide, such as DIs or
stageboxes, if you like - but it may be easier to leave positions of these items
up to them as they probably know the space better than you do.


# Other things to mention

Finally, you may want to mention a few final things to make sure you get what
you need at the event. Things to consider include:
- Room to prepare for your performance or store equipment during the event
- Soundcheck requirements & expectations
- Special access requirements for equipment or people

And finally, one of the most important things to provide is contact details for
someone who will be able to answer any queries relating to your rider or your
performance. An email and phone number would ideally be provided, and it's nice
to include your band's social media links too.
