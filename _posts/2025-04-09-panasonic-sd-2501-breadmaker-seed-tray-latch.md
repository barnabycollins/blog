If you're just coming here to download the 3D model,
[here you go](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/fa1020c287b3f629a80ed386/w/444c6b218c426a601e5adb64/e/8c95fde74b85a76c4fdf33ee).

A few months ago, our beloved breadmaker developed a fault. The plastic latch
that holds the seed dispenser closed had snapped in half. A bit of Googling
indicated that this was a common fault, caused by the constant heat cycling it
experiences above the oven.

Thankfully, Panasonic offers spares for its breadmakers, so it's possible to buy a
[genuine seed dispenser assembly on its own at a reasonable price](https://www.pas-europe.com/shop/p/ADA44E165-H0),
but I came across
[someone else who had 3D-printed a stainless steel replacement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODZDdSyz6OY)
and thought I could have a go too. They had used Shapeways, and it had been possible
to buy a replacement direct from Shapeways based on their model, but Shapeways were
[mid-collapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/1dwqygc)
when I was looking at it, so it wasn't really possible to make a new order on there.

I'd not used CAD before but I wanted to learn, and I'd watched enough videos of
[Martin Molin](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcXhhVwCT6_WqjkEniejRJQ) struggling
to design a marble machine in Fusion360 to be dangerous, so I glued the original
part back together and started measuring. I knew those cheap digital calipers I
bought on a whim during a recreational hardware shop trip would come in handy
eventually!

Eventually I had sketched out the dimensions and turned my sketches into a single
solid object in Onshape. The next step was to find somewhere that would do stainless
steel 3D printing.

I spent a morning uploading my file to various suppliers, and found the cheapest
option to be [IN3DTEC](https://www.in3dtec.com/online-quote/). I ordered the part
for SLM printing in 316L stainless steel. The total came to USD 4.11 for the part,
and USD 24.00 for delivery. I got a 6% new user discount, so the total came to
USD 27.86 - within a couple of pounds of ordering the replacement assembly (priced
at Â£20.76 as of writing this)!

If you're doing this, make sure to prepare a drawing of the part that indicates how
it fits into the mechanism, plus photos of the original part and the space that it
sits in. I got an email from IN3DTEC after ordering, asking if I could provide this
information to help inform them on how to print it.

The part arrived 15 days later, and was a good fit. I found that the end of the 'hook'
was a little too high, a little too rough, and/or a little too sloped, but that was
quickly resolved with a trip to the repair shop, where a rotary tool was available to
grind down the end. The measurements I took were pretty accurate, and used to constrain
the model's dimensions, so I think the issue was caused at least in part by the
difference in finish between the smooth plastic original and the sandblasted steel
replacement - though the edge is also definitely sharper in the model than it was on the
injection-moulded plastic original.

Over six months later, the latch is still working great, and I also get the satisfaction
of knowing it won't break any time soon. I'd definitely recommend doing this, as even
a brand new replacement assembly will presumably experience the same fault eventually.

The latch is publicly available as an Onshape document; you can find it
[here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/fa1020c287b3f629a80ed386/w/444c6b218c426a601e5adb64/e/8c95fde74b85a76c4fdf33ee).
Feel free to modify it to adjust the hook.

There's also another publicly-available model that I only just discovered while Googling
for this article today, available
[here on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5576296).
